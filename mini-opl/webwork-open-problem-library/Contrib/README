New contributions for the OPL should appear here.  When people
download the OPL, they will get these problems as well, so it
is a means for making problems available to others.

By putting problems in this area, the problem authors are giving
OPL maintainers permission to copy problems from this area to the OPL.
The copies are then maintained by the OPL which may modify problems
as needed to blend into the OPL in terms of content and style.

This directory should have one subdirectory for each problem source,
just as in the OPL.  Please include a README file to specify whom
should be contacted if there are questions about problems in the
subdirectory.

Problem here do not needed to be fully "tagged" for the OPL.  People using
these contributions from the Contrib directory will be searching by 
subdirectory.  That said, it is helpful if there is at least a Subject,
and possibly a Chapter tag so that the file is sent to the right person
for review (for inclusion into the OPL).

In addition, if a file references other files such as image files,
please include a tag to indicate what those files are.  So, if a file
uses "image1.png" and "mypic.gif", then include the line

# RESOURCES('image1.png', 'mypic.gif')

to let us know what those files are

Please do not have an image file accessed by more than one problem.  Instead,
just make a copy of the image and have the pg files reference different image
files.  It costs a tiny bit of memory, but makes the files more portable.
